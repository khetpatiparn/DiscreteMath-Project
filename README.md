## About This Project  [ Duration: 27 March - 1 May 2024 ]
This Project was created as a part of an Discrete Mathematics course . The goal of the project was to learn about structures of Graphs, Trees and Finite State Automata.
* **Course:** Discrete Mathematics
* **Faculty of Science:** Department of Computer Science KMITL
* **Academic Year:** the second semester of the first year

### Tools Used

* Java AWT & Swing

## Problems
* Due to the limited time available, the graph results cannot be displayed in GUI format. 

## Example images
### Tree
* set up graph
